# London Bike Rides Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing bike ride data in London using various datasets, Jupyter notebooks, and visualization tools. The goal is to extract insights related to bike-sharing usage, seasonal trends, and financial performance.

## Files and Description
1. **`london_merged.csv`** - Merged dataset containing bike ride data with relevant features.
2. **`london_bikes_finals.xlsx`** - Final cleaned and processed dataset with additional computed metrics.
3. **`London_bikes.ipynb`** - Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis, preprocessing, and visualization.
4. **`London bikes rides finals.twb`** - Tableau Workbook for visual representation and dashboarding of bike ride trends.

## Data Fields
The datasets contain various fields such as:
- `timestamp`: Date and time of bike rides.
- `season`: Seasonal classification (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall).
- `weather`: Weather conditions during the ride.
- `humidity`, `wind_speed`: Environmental factors affecting bike usage.
- `bike_count`: Number of bikes used at a given time.
- `price`, `revenue`, `profit`: Financial metrics related to bike-sharing services.

## Steps to Use
1. Load `london_merged.csv` or `london_bikes_finals.xlsx` into a data processing tool (Python, Excel, SQL, or Power BI).
2. Open `London_bikes.ipynb` to perform data preprocessing, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), and visualization.
3. Use `London bikes rides finals.twb` in Tableau to generate interactive dashboards.

## Tools Used
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)** for data cleaning, analysis, and machine learning.
- **Tableau** for data visualization and trend analysis.
- **Excel** for basic data manipulation and validation.
- **SQL** (if applicable) for querying and data integration.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate machine learning models for demand forecasting.
- Enhance data visualization in Tableau with advanced dashboards.
- Integrate real-time data updates for live tracking of bike usage.
